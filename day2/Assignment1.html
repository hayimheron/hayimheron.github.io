<h1>Uilleann Pipes</h1>
<p>This is my second website</p>

<p>Everyone <i> "knows" </i> the <s> Scottish Pipes </s></p>
<hr> <p> but the <b> Uilleann Pipes </b> are <strong> Irish </strong> </p>
<h3>What </br> sets it apart from Scottish Pipes </br> is </br> how </br> they </br> are </br> played </br> </br> <b> Irish Pipes </b> are played <b> sitting </b> and without your <b> mouth, instead air is pumped in an accordion like fashion usng your arm and a strap meanwhile simultaneously playing this extremely extravagant instrument and making it look easy </b> </h3>
