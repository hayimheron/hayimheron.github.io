I am a native New Yorker, I picked up a phone/camera in 2013 interested in starting a Youtube channel, and by 2015 I upgraded to a serious camera. I got lucky in my first year pursuing a photography career after my first college degree in documentary film. My work was published in my dream papers through my work as a dance photographer and I had an easy time as result persuading established photographers to let me assist them. I assisted Richard Burbridge, Tina Tyrell, Alex Antitch and Roey Yohai and more. When the pandemic hit I was ready for a change and having an identity crisis and not pursuing the photography work I wanted to pursue I thought I should try something new. I eventually ended back banck at my alma mater studying Computer Science and Accounting. Its the best insurance policy I've invested in.  Now, I'm about to graduate and having moonighted as a wedding photographer during this time while back in school, found myself falling back in love with this kind of event/jounrnalistic medium and have figured out a way to make it work."; // Replace with your bio
